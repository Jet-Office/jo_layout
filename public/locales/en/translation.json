There is even the possibility of hourly payment. On more expensive tariff plans, you can really hire an in-house employee, but then training, replacement, and other issues fall on your shoulders. This is a questionable saving, isn't it?\n\n<strong>Thirdly</strong>, a virtual assistant (outsourced assistant) is not much different from an in-house assistant, administrative assistant, or secretary in terms of effectiveness - they are also immersed in the context: they understand the tasks of the business and the needs of the client.\n\n<strong>The cherry on top</strong>: we have a cool network of partners (from product development to coaching), as well as our own AI-based product for automating your routine processes.

It's not as cost-effective as monthly plans, but it allows you to fully assess the service.\n\n<strong>Get Up to 20% Off</strong>: More hours, more discounts!\n\n<strong>PERSONAL</strong>: Good for getting acquainted with the service, small businesses, or personal use. With this plan, JetOffice provides you with an account manager and a part-time assistant. The price per hour is $6.6 with a yearly subscription and $7.9 per hour with a monthly subscription.\n\n<strong>STARTUP</strong>: The golden middle ground. With this plan, you get a full-time assistant for better task immersion and an account manager. You also get an 11% discount compared to the PERSONAL plan. The hourly rate is $5.9 with a yearly subscription and $7.1 per hour with a monthly subscription.\n\n<strong>BUSINESS</strong>: For in-depth work and multitasking. With this plan, you can handle multiple tasks simultaneously because you'll have three full-time assistants and a manager. You'll also get a 20% discount compared to the PERSONAL plan. The hourly rate is $5.2 with a yearly subscription and $6.3 per hour with a monthly subscription.\n\n<strong>ENTERPRISE</strong>: This offers an individualized approach to get more assistants at a more favorable price."

            "text": "The main difference between Annual and Monthly commitment lies in the price and the terms of the agreement. Let's break it down in detail:\n\n<strong>Annual commitment</strong>: The primary benefit for customers when purchasing an Annual commitment plan is a lower hourly rate, and the assurance of a dedicated team focused on your tasks and needs for an extended period. With an annual subscription, you receive up to 20% discount compared to monthly payments. This discount accounts for the inclusion of the risks associated with employee downtime in the monthly pricing.\n\nFor example, the difference in the annual budget on the STARTUP plan between monthly and annual commitment would be $17,040 per year with monthly payments and $14,200 with an annual commitment. This means you save $2,840 per year, which is a 16.7%.\n\nHowever, there are specific considerations that compensate for these lower prices:\n1. You cannot downgrade your subscription until the end of the billing cycle (which means not until the year ends), but you can upgrade at any time.\n2. Canceling your subscription with an annual commitment incurs a penalty equivalent to three months of the subscription cost, excluding the current month.\n3. During payment, the entire annual amount will be charged upfront.\n\n<strong>Monthly commitment</strong>: JetOffice values flexibility, convenience, and simplicity. When you choose a monthly subscription, you are not tied to long-term commitments, but keep in mind that this type of agreement will make your annual expenses higher.\n\nPlease note that transitioning from a monthly subscription to an annual commitment is straightforward, but the reverse is not possible. \n\nFor detailed information on transitioning between plans, please refer to \"Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan anytime?\"\n\nWe recommend starting with a monthly subscription to get acquainted with JetOffice and build trust, and then consider transitioning to an annual commitment for cost savings."

If you have any reservations, we recommend starting with a free trial period or using our hourly payment option with a small balance on your account.\n\n<strong>How is Payment Made?</strong>\nWe provide several payment methods:\n\n<strong>1.

You deposit money into your balance and use JetOffice services for as long as there is money on your account. It's convenient because you can limit your spending.\n2. Secondly, the deposit allows you to make payments on your behalf or on behalf of your company. This is very convenient for various operational and routine payments, such as cleaning services, ticket bookings, accommodation, and so on. We call it Remote payments.\n\n<strong>Remote payments</strong> are a type of service where we pay bills on your behalf. In this way, you only confirm the transaction, and we handle everything else. \nThe transaction is processed from our bank account, while the funds are deducted from your balance. This way, we have bypassed the necessity of linking your card to our service. In the future, we will strive to add the option for clients to link their card and make transactions directly from it.\n\n<strong>Attention!</strong> JetOffice limits the payment capabilities. We do not pay for: risky transactions, business deals, investment transactions, payments to exchanges and brokers, currency purchases and conversions, the purchase of illegal goods such as weapons, drugs, etc. Anything that has serious consequences and requires specialized expertise falls outside the scope of our remote payment service.\n\nWe can only process non-risky payments and transactions that do not require professional auditing, such as:\n\n- Ordering food or a taxi.\n- Paying for simple services, such as car repairs or house cleaning.\n- Buying tickets, booking accommodations, renting transportation.\n- Purchasing movie tickets or paying for a restaurant reservation.\n- Paying for grocery orders or personal items. \n- And much more... The key is that the financial transaction should be legal and not require in-depth and specialized auditing.\n\n<strong>Attention!</strong> We are not responsible for any consequences faced by the client in Remote payments once the client has approved the payment. After payment approval, for example, purchasing plane tickets with specific dates, the responsibility lies with the client.\n\n<strong>Attention!</strong> We reserve the right to decline the Remote Payment service if we deem it risky, dangerous, or illegal."

After the yearly subscription ends, clients can choose a monthly plan.\nCancellation of Yearly Subscription: Client-initiated cancellation of the yearly subscription incurs a penalty equal to the cost of three months' subscription."

When the system notifies you about reaching your time limit, you'll have the following options:\n\n1. Purchase a new package: In this case, the countdown will start from a new date.\n2. Use hourly rate billing: To do this, you'll need to deposit funds into your account.\n3. Suspend task execution until the beginning of the next billing period.\n\nIf your package hours run out, you won't be able to work beyond the allocated hours until you purchase a new package or opt for hourly rate billing."

Three hours are enough for a small test. \n\nHourly Rate: If you need more time to get familiar with JetOffice assistants, use our hourly rate.

However, you can always use these funds for hourly payments, and they have no expiration date."

        "question": "Annual and monthly commitment",
        "text": "The main difference between Annual and Monthly commitment lies in the price and the terms of the agreement. Let's break it down in detail:\n\nAnnual commitment: The primary benefit for customers when purchasing an Annual commitment plan is a lower hourly rate, and the assurance of a dedicated team focused on your tasks and needs for an extended period. With an annual subscription, you receive up to 20% discount compared to monthly payments. This discount accounts for the inclusion of the risks associated with employee downtime in the monthly pricing.\n\nFor example, the difference in the annual budget on the STARTUP plan between monthly and annual commitment would be $17,040 per year with monthly payments and $14,200 with an annual commitment. This means you save $2,840 per year, which is a 16.7%.\n\nHowever, there are specific considerations that compensate for these lower prices:\n1. You cannot downgrade your subscription until the end of the billing cycle (which means not until the year ends), but you can upgrade at any time.\n2. Canceling your subscription with an annual commitment incurs a penalty equivalent to three months of the subscription cost, excluding the current month.\n3. During payment, the entire annual amount will be charged upfront.\n\nMonthly commitment: JetOffice values flexibility, convenience, and simplicity. When you choose a monthly subscription, you are not tied to long-term commitments, but keep in mind that this type of agreement will make your annual expenses higher.\n\nPlease note that transitioning from a monthly subscription to an annual commitment is straightforward, but the reverse is not possible. \n\nFor detailed information on transitioning between plans, please refer to \"Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan anytime?\"\n\nWe recommend starting with a monthly subscription to get acquainted with JetOffice and build trust, and then consider transitioning to an annual commitment for cost savings."

        "text": "A JetOffice deposit provides several possibilities:\n\n1. Firstly, you can use it for hourly payment. You deposit money into your balance and use JetOffice services for as long as there is money on your account. It's convenient because you can limit your spending.\n2. Secondly, the deposit allows you to make payments on your behalf or on behalf of your company. This is very convenient for various operational and routine payments, such as cleaning services, ticket bookings, accommodation, and so on. We call it Remote payments.\n\nRemote payments are a type of service where we pay bills on your behalf. In this way, you only confirm the transaction, and we handle everything else. \nThe transaction is processed from our bank account, while the funds are deducted from your balance. This way, we have bypassed the necessity of linking your card to our service. In the future, we will strive to add the option for clients to link their card and make transactions directly from it.\n\nAttention! JetOffice limits the payment capabilities. We do not pay for: risky transactions, business deals, investment transactions, payments to exchanges and brokers, currency purchases and conversions, the purchase of illegal goods such as weapons, drugs, etc. Anything that has serious consequences and requires specialized expertise falls outside the scope of our remote payment service.\n\nWe can only process non-risky payments and transactions that do not require professional auditing, such as:\n\n- Ordering food or a taxi.\n- Paying for simple services, such as car repairs or house cleaning.\n- Buying tickets, booking accommodations, renting transportation.\n- Purchasing movie tickets or paying for a restaurant reservation.\n- Paying for grocery orders or personal items. \n- And much more... The key is that the financial transaction should be legal and not require in-depth and specialized auditing.\n\nAttention! We are not responsible for any consequences faced by the client in Remote payments once the client has approved the payment. After payment approval, for example, purchasing plane tickets with specific dates, the responsibility lies with the client.\n\nAttention! We reserve the right to decline the Remote Payment service if we deem it risky, dangerous, or illegal."
